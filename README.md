# HORISEON WEBPAGE REFACTOR

## A marketing webpage for the marketing agency Horiseon, whose code requires refactoring



## SUMMARY


My main goal was to ensure that the website had improved accessibility.
Secondly I aimed to refactor the code for this website and ensure syntax was improved.
Finally I wanted  to ensure all links functioned correctly.

There were important changes to implement firstly from a user perspective, the user experience could be improved upon by adding accessible features to the webpage.
From a developers perspective, the code layout and syntax could be improved upon to make future work in the code much easier.

Moving forward, keep an eye out for tag syntax.
Refrain from rearranging file set up as it will disrupt pathing of the code in Index file and CSS and break the webpage.
Aim to add alt attributes for images as they are added in in order to mitigate confusion and avoid forgetting to have them included.
